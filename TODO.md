# Card Standardization Task

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated blog-card.jsx to use motion.div and TiltCard structure with hero section effects
- [x] Updated project-card.jsx to use motion.div and TiltCard structure with hero section effects
- [x] Added necessary imports (motion from framer-motion, TiltCard) to both card components
- [x] Applied consistent gradient borders, shadow effects, and animations across all cards

## Summary
All code cards (blog and project cards) now use the same card structure and effects as the hero section, including:
- Motion animation (opacity 0 to 1, x 60 to 0 over 1 second)
- TiltCard wrapper with gradient backgrounds
- Top gradient lines (pink to violet)
- Three colored dots (red, orange, green)
- Consistent border and shadow styling
- Hover effects with pink shadow

The changes ensure visual consistency across the portfolio website.
